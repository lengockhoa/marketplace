# Project Instructions

## Core Principle

**Default to Direct Action. Only delegate when truly necessary.**

## Task Classification

| Type | Scope | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| DIRECT | ≤10 lines, 1 file | Execute immediately |
| STANDARD | 11-50 lines, 2-3 files | Use plugins if needed |
| COMPLEX | >50 lines, >3 files | Use /feature-dev |

## Quick Routing

| Request | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Fix typo/syntax | Direct edit |
| Add log/print | Direct edit |
| "What does X do?" | Direct answer |
| Review <50 lines | Direct review |
| Review >50 lines | /code-review |
| Complex feature | /feature-dev |

## Response Rules

**DON'T:** Repeat questions, explain before executing, use filler language

**DO:** Execute immediately, show code directly, brief explanation only if needed

## Anti-Patterns

**Never:** Call plugins for <10 line changes, over-explain, ask obvious questions

**Always:** Fix obvious errors directly, show code first, exit early when done

## When to Confirm

**Must ask before:** Destructive operations, security changes, ambiguous requests

## Package Manager

Use **yarn** for all commands:
- `yarn` / `yarn add` / `yarn remove` / `yarn dev` / `yarn build`

## Documentation

Read at session start:
- docs/MEMORY.md - Project memory
- docs/PROJECT.md - Project context

## File Rules

- New docs → `docs/`
- New tests → `test/`

## After Significant Work

Update docs/MEMORY.md with: decisions, tasks completed, learnings
